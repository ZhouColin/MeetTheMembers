# MeetTheMembers
This is my first project for Mobile Developers of Berkeley! I had lots of fun figuring out the in's and out's of navigation, functions, and more. This overall was a very interesting learning curve that I found useful. Things I would do differently next time is focus more on the scaling and constraints of the components, and figure out how to make this app look a bit fancier.
